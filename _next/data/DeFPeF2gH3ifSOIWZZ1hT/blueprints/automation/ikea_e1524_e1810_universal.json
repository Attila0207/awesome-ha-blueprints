Supports remotes integrated with either Zigbee2MQTT, deCONZ or ZHA. Just specify the integration used to connect the remote to Home Assistant when setting up the automation, and the blueprint will take care of all the rest.\n\nIn addition of being able to provide custom actions for every kind of button press supported by the remote, the blueprint allows to loop the long press actions while the corresponding button is being held. Once released, the loop stops. This is useful when holding down a button should result in a continuous action (such as lowering the volume of a media player, or controlling a light brightness).\n\n## Examples\n\n### Light control with brightness and color temperature control\n\n```yaml\n\nalias: IKEA E1524/E1810 5-button Remote - Light Control\ndescription: Control a Light with an IKEA E1524/E1810 remote\nuse_blueprint:\n  path: EPMatt/ikea_e1524_e1810_universal.yaml\n  input:\n    integration: deCONZ\n    remote: <your_remote_device_id>\n    action_left_short:\n      - service: light.turn_on\n        data:\n          color_temp: '{{ state_attr(\"light.your_light\",\"color_temp\")-50 }}'\n          transition: 0.25\n        entity_id: light.your_light\n    action_left_long:\n      - service: light.turn_on\n        data:\n          color_temp: '{{ state_attr(\"light.your_light\",\"color_temp\")-50 }}'\n          transition: 0.25\n        entity_id: light.your_light\n      - delay:\n          milliseconds: 250\n    action_right_short:\n      - service: light.turn_on\n        data:\n          color_temp: '{{ state_attr(\"light.your_light\",\"color_temp\")+50 }}'\n          transition: 0.25\n        entity_id: light.your_light\n    action_right_long:\n      - service: light.turn_on\n        data:\n          color_temp: '{{ state_attr(\"light.your_light\",\"color_temp\")+50 }}'\n          transition: 0.25\n        entity_id: light.your_light\n      - delay:\n          milliseconds: 250\n    action_up_short:\n      - service: light.turn_on\n        data:\n          brightness_step_pct: 10\n          transition: 0.25\n        entity_id: light.your_light\n    action_up_long:\n      - service: light.turn_on\n        data:\n          brightness_step_pct: 10\n          transition: 0.25\n        entity_id: light.your_light\n      - delay:\n          milliseconds: 250\n    action_down_short:\n      - service: light.turn_on\n        data:\n          brightness_step_pct: -10\n          transition: 0.25\n        entity_id: light.your_light\n    action_down_long:\n      - service: light.turn_on\n        data:\n          brightness_step_pct: -10\n          transition: 0.25\n        entity_id: light.your_light\n      - delay:\n          milliseconds: 250\n    action_center_short:\n      - type: toggle\n        device_id: <your_light_device_id>\n        entity_id: light.your_light\n        domain: light\n    button_left_long_loop: true\n    button_right_long_loop: true\n    button_up_long_loop: true\n    button_down_long_loop: true\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\n### (Optional) Zigbee2MQTT\n\nIf you plan to integrate the 5-button remote with Zigbee2MQTT, you must have this integration set up. Installation methods differ between different installation types. Check the documentation for this integration for full details on the required hardware and how to set up Zigbee2MQTT on your system.\n\n[Zigbee2MQTT Docs](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/)\n\n### (Optional) ZHA Integration\n\nIf you plan to integrate the 5-button remote with ZHA, you must have this integration set up. The integration can be setup from the Home Assistant UI. Check the documentation for this integration for full details on the required hardware.\n\n[ZHA Integration Docs](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/zha/)\n\n### (Optional) deCONZ Integration\n\nIf you plan to integrate the 5-button remote with deCONZ, you must have this integration set up. The integration can be setup from the Home Assistant UI and requires an additional container to run deCONZ on. Head over to the documentation for this integration for full details on the required hardware and how to set up deCONZ on your system.\n\n[deCONZ Integration Docs](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/deconz/)\n\n### (Optional) Input Text Integration\n\nThis integration provides the entity to store the last button event, which is needed when using ZHA to integrate the remote and determining which button has been released. This should be activated by default so unless you tweaked the default configuration you're good to go.\n\n[Input Text Integration Docs](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/input_text/)\n\n## Inputs\n\n### Integration\n\nIntegration used for connecting the remote with Home Assistant. Type \"Zigbee2MQTT\", \"deCONZ\" or \"ZHA\".\n\n### (ZHA, deCONZ) Remote\n\nThe IKEA remote to use for the automation. Choose a value only if the remote is integrated with deCONZ or ZHA.\n\n### (Zigbee2MQTT) Remote Action Sensor\n\nThe action sensor of the IKEA remote to use for the automation. Choose a value only if the remote is integrated with Zigbee2MQTT.\n\n### (Optional) Left button - short press\n\nAction to run on short left button press.\n\n### (Optional) Left button - long press\n\nAction to run on long left button press.\n\n### (Optional) Left button - release after long press\n\nAction to run on left button release after a long press.\n\n### (Optional)  Right button - short press\n\nAction to run on short right button press.\n\n### (Optional) Right button - long press\n\nAction to run on long right button press.\n\n### (Optional) Right button - release after long press\n\nAction to run on right button release after a long press.\n\n### (Optional) Up button - short press\n\nAction to run on short up button press.\n\n### (Optional) Up button - long press\n\nAction to run on long up button press.\n\n### (Optional) Up button - release after long press\n\nAction to run on up button release after a long press.\n\n### (Optional) Down button - short press\n\nAction to run on short down button press.\n\n### (Optional) Down button - long press\n\nAction to run on long down button press.\n\n### (Optional) Down button - release after long press\n\nAction to run on down button release after a long press.\n\n### (Optional) Center button - short press\n\nAction to run on short center button press.\n\n### (Optional) Center button - long press\n\nAction to run on long center button press.\n\n### Long left button press - loop until release\n\nBoolean to indicate whether to loop the action until the button is released.\n\n### Long right button press - loop until release\n\nBoolean to indicate whether to loop the action until the button is released.\n\n### Long up button press - loop until release\n\nBoolean to indicate whether to loop the action until the button is released.\n\n### Long down button press - loop until release\n\nBoolean to indicate whether to loop the action until the button is released.\n\n### (ZHA) Helper - Last Long Press Event\n\nInput Text used to store the last long press event. Provide an entity only if the remote is integrated with ZHA.\n\n## Additional Notes\n\nThe reason why a text input is required to store the last long press event when using a remote with ZHA is because of the actions mapping for the controller in ZHA. Natively, the controller doesn't allow to distinguish between different button release events, so the blueprint must store the previous clicked button, using the text input. Make sure the input text is not altered by any other agents, since this could break the automation.\n","category":"automation","id":"ikea_e1524_e1810_universal"},"__N_SSG":true}
