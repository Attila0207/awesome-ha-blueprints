Supports brightness and color control both for white temperature and rgb lights.\n\nAn automation created with this blueprint must be linked to a [Controller](https://epmatt.github.io/awesome-ha-blueprints/blueprints/controllers) automation. Controllers are blueprints which allow to easily integrate a wide range of controllers and use them to run a set of actions when interacting with them. They expose an abstract interface used by Hooks to create controller-based automations.\n\nSee the list of [Controllers supported by this Hook](https://epmatt.github.io/awesome-ha-blueprints/blueprints/hooks/light#supported-controllers) for additional details.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Controller Automation\n\nTo use this blueprint you need to first create an automation with a Controller blueprint. You can then create an automation with this Hook, **making sure that you provide the same controller device or entity used in the corresponding Controller blueprint**. This key step will link the two automations and ensure the Hook will respond to events fired by the Controller.\n\n[List of Supported Controllers](https://epmatt.github.io/awesome-ha-blueprints/blueprints/hooks/light#supported-controllers)\n[Controllers Docs](https://epmatt.github.io/awesome-ha-blueprints/blueprints/controllers)\n\n### Light Integration\n\nThis integration provides the entity which represents a light in Home Assistant. It should be activated by default so unless you tweaked the default configuration you're good to go.\n\n[Light Integration Docs](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/light/)\n\n## Inputs\n\n<Input\n name='Controller device'\n description='The controller device which will control the light. Choose a value only if the integration used to connect the controller to Home Assistant exposes it as a Device. This value should match the one specified in the corresponding Controller automation.'\n selector='device'\n />\n<Input\n name='Controller entity'\n description='The controller entity which will control the light. Choose a value only if the integration used to connect the controller to Home Assistant exposes it as an Entity. This value should match the one specified in the corresponding Controller automation.'\n selector='entity'\n />\n<Input\n name='Controller model'\n description='The model for the controller used in this automation. Choose a value from the list of supported controllers.'\n selector='select'\n required\n />\n<Input\n name='Light'\n description='Light which will be controlled with this automation.'\n selector='entity'\n required\n />\n<Input\n name='Light Color Mode'\n description='Specify how the controller will set the light color. Choose \"Color Temperature\" and \"Hue - Saturation\" depending on the features supported by your light. If you are not sure you can select \"Auto\"'\n selector='select'\n />\n<Input\n name='Light Transition'\n description='Number that represents the time (in milliseconds) the light should take turn on or off, if the light supports it.'\n selector='number'\n />\n\n## Supported Controllers\n\n- [IKEA E1524/E1810 5-Button remote](https://epmatt.github.io/awesome-ha-blueprints/blueprints/controllers/ikea_e1524_e1810)\n- [IKEA E1743 On/Off Switch & Dimmer](https://epmatt.github.io/awesome-ha-blueprints/blueprints/controllers/ikea_e1743)\n- [IKEA E1744 SYMFONISK rotary remote](https://epmatt.github.io/awesome-ha-blueprints/blueprints/controllers/ikea_e1744)\n- [IKEA E1812 Shortcut button](https://epmatt.github.io/awesome-ha-blueprints/blueprints/controllers/ikea_e1812)\n\n## Additional Notes\n\nIf you want to link multiple lights to the same controller you can either use [Light Groups](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/light.group/) or build multiple Hooks linked to the same Controller.\n","category":"hooks","id":"light","tocData":[{"content":"Light","slug":"light","lvl":1,"i":0,"seen":0},{"content":"Description","slug":"description","lvl":2,"i":1,"seen":0},{"content":"Requirements","slug":"requirements","lvl":2,"i":2,"seen":0},{"content":"Controller Automation","slug":"controller-automation","lvl":3,"i":3,"seen":0},{"content":"Light Integration","slug":"light-integration","lvl":3,"i":4,"seen":0},{"content":"Inputs","slug":"inputs","lvl":2,"i":5,"seen":0},{"content":"Supported Controllers","slug":"supported-controllers","lvl":2,"i":6,"seen":0},{"content":"Additional Notes","slug":"additional-notes","lvl":2,"i":7,"seen":0}]},"__N_SSG":true}
