{"pageProps":{"data":{"name":"IKEA E1744 SYMFONISK Rotary Remote","description":"Controller automation for executing any kind of action triggered by an IKEA E1744 remote controller. Supports Zigbee2MQTT, deCONZ, ZHA."},"content":"\n# IKEA E1744 SYMFONISK Rotary Remote\n\n## Description\n\nThis blueprint provides universal support for running any custom action when a button is pressed on the provided IKEA E1744 remote controller. Supports remotes integrated with either Zigbee2MQTT, deCONZ or ZHA. Just specify the integration used to connect the remote to Home Assistant when setting up the automation, and the blueprint will take care of all the rest.\n\nIn addition of being able to provide custom actions for every kind of button press supported by the remote, the blueprint allows to optionally loop the rotate actions while the remote is rotating either left or right. Once the remote stops rotating, the loop stops as well. This is useful when rotating the controller should result in a continuous action (such as lowering the volume of a media player, or controlling a light brightness).\n\nMoreover, automations created with this blueprint can be connected with one or more [Hooks](https://epmatt.github.io/awesome-ha-blueprints/blueprints/hooks) supported by this controller.\nHooks allow to easily create controller-based automations for interacting with media players, lights, covers and more. See the list of [Hooks available for this controller](https://epmatt.github.io/awesome-ha-blueprints/blueprints/controllers/ikea_e1744#available-hooks) for additional details.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### (Optional) Zigbee2MQTT\n\nIf you plan to integrate the E1744 SYMFONISK Rotary Remote with Zigbee2MQTT, you must have this integration set up. Installation methods differ between different installation types. Check out the documentation for full details on the required hardware and how to set up Zigbee2MQTT on your system.\n\nWhen configuring the remote with Zigbee2MQTT make sure to disable the legacy integration for it, as reported [here](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/devices/E1744.html#legacy-integration). This blueprint won't work with controllers with a legacy integration due to their instability and fundamental problems.\n\n[Zigbee2MQTT Docs](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/)\n\n### (Optional) ZHA Integration\n\nIf you plan to integrate the E1744 SYMFONISK Rotary Remote with ZHA, you must have this integration set up. The ZHA integration can be configured from the Home Assistant UI. Check the documentation for full details on the required hardware and how to set up ZHA on your system.\n\n[ZHA Integration Docs](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/zha/)\n\n### (Optional) deCONZ Integration\n\nIf you plan to integrate the E1744 SYMFONISK Rotary Remote with deCONZ, you must have this integration set up. The deCONZ integration can be configured from the Home Assistant UI and requires an additional container to run deCONZ on. Head over to the documentation for full details on the required hardware and how to set up deCONZ on your system.\n\n[deCONZ Integration Docs](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/deconz/)\n\n### (Optional) Input Text Integration\n\nThis integration provides the entity to store the last controller event, which is needed when using ZHA or Zigbee2MQTT to integrate the remote and determining how the remote stopped the rotation. This should be activated by default so unless you tweaked the default configuration you're good to go.\n\n[Input Text Integration Docs](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/input_text/)\n\n## Inputs\n\n<Input\n name='Integration'\n description='Integration used for connecting the remote with Home Assistant.

Natively, the controller doesn't allow to distinguish between different rotation events, so the blueprint must store the previous rotation, using the text input. Make sure the input text is not altered by any other agents, since this could break the automation.\n","category":"controllers","id":"ikea_e1744","tocData":[{"content":"IKEA E1744 SYMFONISK Rotary Remote","slug":"ikea-e1744-symfonisk-rotary-remote","lvl":1,"i":0,"seen":0},{"content":"Description","slug":"description","lvl":2,"i":1,"seen":0},{"content":"Requirements","slug":"requirements","lvl":2,"i":2,"seen":0},{"content":"(Optional) Zigbee2MQTT","slug":"optional-zigbee2mqtt","lvl":3,"i":3,"seen":0},{"content":"(Optional) ZHA Integration","slug":"optional-zha-integration","lvl":3,"i":4,"seen":0},{"content":"(Optional) deCONZ Integration","slug":"optional-deconz-integration","lvl":3,"i":5,"seen":0},{"content":"(Optional) Input Text Integration","slug":"optional-input-text-integration","lvl":3,"i":6,"seen":0},{"content":"Inputs","slug":"inputs","lvl":2,"i":7,"seen":0},{"content":"Available Hooks","slug":"available-hooks","lvl":2,"i":8,"seen":0},{"content":"Light","slug":"light","lvl":3,"i":9,"seen":0},{"content":"Media Player","slug":"media-player","lvl":3,"i":10,"seen":0},{"content":"Additional Notes","slug":"additional-notes","lvl":2,"i":11,"seen":0}]},"__N_SSG":true}
