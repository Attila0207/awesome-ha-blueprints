{"pageProps":{"data":{"name":"IKEA E1812 Shortcut button","description":"Controller automation for executing any kind of action triggered by an IKEA E1812 remote controller. Allows to optionally loop an action on a button long press. Supports Zigbee2MQTT, deCONZ, ZHA."},"content":"\n# IKEA E1812 Shortcut button\n\n## Description\n\nThis blueprint provides universal support for running any custom action when the button is pressed on the provided IKEA E1812 remote controller. Supports remotes integrated with either Zigbee2MQTT, deCONZ or ZHA. Just specify the integration used to connect the remote to Home Assistant when setting up the automation, and the blueprint will take care of all the rest.\n\nIn addition of being able to provide custom actions for every kind of button press supported by the remote, the blueprint allows to loop the long press actions while the corresponding button is being held. Once released, the loop stops. This is useful when holding down a button should result in a continuous action (such as lowering the volume of a media player, or controlling a light brightness).\nThe blueprint also adds support for virtual double button press events, which are not exposed by the controller itself.\n\nMoreover, automations created with this blueprint can be connected with one or more [Hooks](https://epmatt.github.io/awesome-ha-blueprints/blueprints/hooks) supported by this controller.\nHooks allow to easily create controller-based automations for interacting with media players, lights, covers and more. See the list of [Hooks available for this controller](https://epmatt.github.io/awesome-ha-blueprints/blueprints/controllers/ikea_e1812#available-hooks) for additional details.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### (Optional) Zigbee2MQTT\n\nIf you plan to integrate the E1812 Shortcut button with Zigbee2MQTT, you must have this integration set up. Installation methods differ between different installation types. Check the documentation for this integration for full details on the required hardware and how to set up Zigbee2MQTT on your system.\n\n[Zigbee2MQTT Docs](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/)\n\n### (Optional) ZHA Integration\n\nIf you plan to integrate the E1812 Shortcut button with ZHA, you must have this integration set up. The integration can be setup from the Home Assistant UI. Check the documentation for this integration for full details on the required hardware.\n\n[ZHA Integration Docs](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/zha/)\n\n### (Optional) deCONZ Integration\n\nIf you plan to integrate the E1812 Shortcut button with deCONZ, you must have this integration set up. The integration can be setup from the Home Assistant UI and requires an additional container to run deCONZ on. Head over to the documentation for this integration for full details on the required hardware and how to set up deCONZ on your system.\n\n[deCONZ Integration Docs](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/deconz/)\n\n### (Optional) Input Text Integration\n\nThis integration provides the entity to store the last button event, which is needed when using virtual double press events. This should be activated by default so unless you tweaked the default configuration you're good to go.\n\n[Input Text Integration Docs](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/input_text/)\n\n## Inputs\n\n<Input\n name='Integration'\n description='Integration used for connecting the remote with Home Assistant.

This blueprint provides virtual double press events by relying on the provided text input, used to store the last short press event, and a delay, which represents the maximum time gap between the first and second short press required to trigger the virtual double press. Make sure the input text is not altered by any other agents, since this could break the automation.\n\nWhen double press events are enabled, clicking the button results in the automation first waiting for the second button press, then, if none is received within the provided delay, executing the short press action.\n\nIf double press events are disabled, the corresponding single press action will be executed immediately when the button is pressed.\n","category":"controllers","id":"ikea_e1812","tocData":[{"content":"IKEA E1812 Shortcut button","slug":"ikea-e1812-shortcut-button","lvl":1,"i":0,"seen":0},{"content":"Description","slug":"description","lvl":2,"i":1,"seen":0},{"content":"Requirements","slug":"requirements","lvl":2,"i":2,"seen":0},{"content":"(Optional) Zigbee2MQTT","slug":"optional-zigbee2mqtt","lvl":3,"i":3,"seen":0},{"content":"(Optional) ZHA Integration","slug":"optional-zha-integration","lvl":3,"i":4,"seen":0},{"content":"(Optional) deCONZ Integration","slug":"optional-deconz-integration","lvl":3,"i":5,"seen":0},{"content":"(Optional) Input Text Integration","slug":"optional-input-text-integration","lvl":3,"i":6,"seen":0},{"content":"Inputs","slug":"inputs","lvl":2,"i":7,"seen":0},{"content":"Available Hooks","slug":"available-hooks","lvl":2,"i":8,"seen":0},{"content":"Light","slug":"light","lvl":3,"i":9,"seen":0},{"content":"Media Player","slug":"media-player","lvl":3,"i":10,"seen":0},{"content":"Additional Notes","slug":"additional-notes","lvl":2,"i":11,"seen":0}]},"__N_SSG":true}
