Supports volume setting, play/pause and track selection.\n\nAn automation created with this blueprint must be linked to a [Controller](https://epmatt.github.io/awesome-ha-blueprints/blueprints/controllers) automation. Controllers are blueprints which allow to easily integrate a wide range of controllers and use them to run a set of actions when interacting with them. They expose an abstract interface used by Hooks to create controller-based automations.\n\nSee the list of [Controllers supported by this Hook](https://epmatt.github.io/awesome-ha-blueprints/blueprints/hooks/media_player#supported-controllers) for additional details.\n\n## Requirements\n\n<Requirement\n id='controller'\n required\n />\n<Requirement\nname='Media Player Integration'\nrequired\n\n> This integration provides the entity which represents a media player in Home Assistant. It should be activated by default so unless you tweaked the default configuration you're good to go.\n\n[Media Player Integration Docs](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/media_player/)\n</Requirement>\n\n## Inputs\n\n<Input\n name='Controller device'\n description='The controller device which will control the light. Choose a value only if the integration used to connect the controller to Home Assistant exposes it as a Device. This value should match the one specified in the corresponding Controller automation.'\n selector='device'\n />\n<Input\n name='Controller entity'\n description='The controller entity which will control the light. Choose a value only if the integration used to connect the controller to Home Assistant exposes it as an Entity. This value should match the one specified in the corresponding Controller automation.'\n selector='entity'\n />\n<Input\n name='Controller model'\n description='The model for the controller used in this automation.
