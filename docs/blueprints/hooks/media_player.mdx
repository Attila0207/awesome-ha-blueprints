## Description

This Hook blueprint allow to build a controller-based automation to control a media player. Supports volume setting, play/pause and track selection.

An automation created with this blueprint must be linked to a [Controller](https://epmatt.github.io/awesome-ha-blueprints/blueprints/controllers) automation. Controllers are blueprints which allow to easily integrate a wide range of controllers and use them to run a set of actions when interacting with them. They expose an abstract interface used by Hooks to create controller-based automations.

See the list of [Controllers supported by this Hook](/docs/blueprints/hooks/media_player#supported-controllers) for additional details.

## Requirements

<Requirement
 id='controller'
 required
 />
<Requirement
name='Media Player Integration'
required>

This integration provides the entity which represents a media player in Home Assistant. It should be activated by default so unless you tweaked the default configuration you're good to go.
