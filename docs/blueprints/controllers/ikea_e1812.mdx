title: IKEA E1812 Shortcut button
description: Controller automation for executing any kind of action triggered by an IKEA E1812 remote controller. Allows to optionally loop an action on a button long press. Supports Zigbee2MQTT, deCONZ, ZHA.
---


## Description

This blueprint provides universal support for running any custom action when the button is pressed on the provided IKEA E1812 remote controller. Supports remotes integrated with either Zigbee2MQTT, deCONZ or ZHA. Just specify the integration used to connect the remote to Home Assistant when setting up the automation, and the blueprint will take care of all the rest.

In addition of being able to provide custom actions for every kind of button press supported by the remote, the blueprint allows to loop the long press action while the button is being held. Once released, the loop stops. This is useful when holding down the button should result in a continuous action (such as lowering the volume of a media player, or controlling a light brightness).
The blueprint also adds support for virtual double button press events, which are not exposed by the controller itself.

Moreover, automations created with this blueprint can be connected with one or more [Hooks](https://epmatt.github.io/awesome-ha-blueprints/blueprints/hooks) supported by this controller.
Hooks allow to easily create controller-based automations for interacting with media players, lights, covers and more. See the list of [Hooks available for this controller](https://epmatt.github.io/awesome-ha-blueprints/blueprints/controllers/ikea_e1812#available-hooks) for additional details.

## Requirements

<Requirement
 id='zha'

<Requirement
 id='deconz'

<Requirement
 name='Input Text Integration'
 required='Double press action'>
This integration provides the entity to store the last button event, which is needed when using virtual double press events. This should be activated by default so unless you tweaked the default configuration you're good to go.

## Additional Notes

It's also important to notice that the controller doesn't natively support double press events. This blueprint provides virtual double press events by relying on the provided text input, used to store the last short press event, and a delay, which represents the maximum time gap between the first and second short press required to trigger the virtual double press. Make sure the input text is not altered by any other agents, since this could break the automation.

When double press events are enabled, clicking the button results in the automation first waiting for the second button press, then, if none is received within the provided delay, executing the short press action.

If double press events are disabled, the corresponding single press action will be executed immediately when the button is pressed.
