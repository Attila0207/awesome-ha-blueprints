Each blueprint included in the collection will be:\n\n- **Highly customizable** and **flexible** to user needs, but still hiding the complexity of their internal working to the user;\n- **Reliable** on most situations and corner cases;\n- **Fully maintained**, collaboratively **developed** and **tested by the community**.\n\nOne of the main focuses of the project is on **Reliability**.

Look for the blueprint you'd like to import [here](https://epmatt.github.io/awesome-ha-blueprints/blueprints);\n2. In the page of the blueprint you'd like to import, click on the **Copy Link** button on the top of the page. The URL for the blueprint is now in your clipboard;\n3. On your Home Assistant instance go to **Configuration** and then **Blueprints**\n4. Click on the **Import Blueprint** button in the bottom right corner. A new dialog will pop-up;\n5. Paste the URL for the blueprint and click on **Preview Blueprint**;\n6. If desided change the name of the blueprint and finish the import;\n7. You're good to go! Now your blueprint can be used for generating automations.\n\nCheck out the [Official documentation on Using Automation Blueprints](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/using_blueprints/) for the detailed process of importing blueprints into Home Assistant and using them for automations.\n\n## Contributing to the project\n\nPlease check our [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/EPMatt/awesome-ha-blueprints/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for additional information on how to contribute.
